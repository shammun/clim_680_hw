# The Effect of Indian Ocean Dipole 🌊 on Temperature ☀️ in Asia 

**Shammunul Islam (sislam27@mason.edu)** 👋

## ✨ Intro 

Due to climate variability and climate change, the world 🌎 is continuously affected by different extreme events, especially associated with high temperature. Asia is affected by many calamities caused by high temperature driven events. Indian Ocean 🌊 plays a critical role in the atmospheric dynamics of this region, particularly, Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) 🌊, an oscillation of temperature in Indian Ocean equivalent to ENSO in central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. In this project, it is investigated whether there is any relationship between different phases of IOD 🌊, which areas have these relationships and whether these are statistically significant.

For doing this study, APHRODITE Water Resources project data for daily mean temperature ☀️ is chosen as they have daily temperature data from 1962 upto 2015 in a gridded format with a high spatial resolution of 0.5 degree by 0.25 degree. For sea surface temperature, NOAA OISST V2 SST data is used as it has good spatial and temporal coverage.

There are mainly 3 notebooks [HW1_New.ipynb](https://github.com/shammun/clim_680_hw/blob/main/HW1_New.ipynb), [HW2_New.ipynb](https://github.com/shammun/clim_680_hw/blob/main/HW2_New.ipynb), and [HW3_New.ipynb](https://github.com/shammun/clim_680_hw/blob/main/HW3_New.ipynb) that show you step by step process with Python code on how to analyze temperature and sea surface temperature data using XArray, Dask and many more!! This repository contains a collection of insightful Jupyter Notebooks and a dedicated GitHub Page built in requirement for the class project of 680: Climate Data, a course required for PhD in CLimate Dynamics, at George Mason Universityy.

One caveat though 🙃, as the data size is huge, you will have to download the data by yourself in your local computer before you can run the code. 

Ohh, by the way, look at this Github page 📖 [https://shammun.github.io/clim_680_hw/](https://shammun.github.io/clim_680_hw/) associated with the repository that walks you through the codes and that also discusses the results.
